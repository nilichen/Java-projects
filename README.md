- Object Oriented Java Programming: Data Structures and Beyond Specialization
	- UnfoldingMaps

		In the project we will build your own interactive visualization of a large dataset tagged by geospatial information. Both powerful and challenging, data visualization is one of the hot topics of modern computer science - as well as something that influences our world every day!

	- MOOCTextEditor

		The project is to build a smart text editor/processor that incorporates “intelligent” behaviors of modern-day text interfaces including autocomplete, flagging misspelled words and spelling auto-correct. In each module you’ll add a bit more functionality to your editor through the project associated with that module.

	-  Graphs

		The project is to build a mapping application with the ability to provide and visualize routes from one point to another in a map by implementing basic graph search algorithms including breadth first search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, and A* Search
